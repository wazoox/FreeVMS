GRUB LEGACY IS IN FEATURE FREEZE

  Before you submit a request for new feature, please note that GRUB Legacy is
  in feature freeze (both in upstream and in debian) and only bug fixes are
  accepted.  All requests for new features will be rejected; even if you provide
  a patch, or if the feature is specific to debian.

  Please, rather than directing your work at a frozen branch, look at wether
  your proposed feature makes sense in GRUB 2.  GRUB 2 is in active development
  (both debian and upstream) and new features are welcome there.
