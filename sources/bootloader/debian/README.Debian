grub for Debian
---------------

GRUB is a GPLed bootloader intended to unify bootloading across x86
operating systems.  In addition to loading Linux and FreeBSD, it
implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the GNU
Hurd).

One unique feature of GRUB is that it can understand filesystems at
boot time, rather than just simple blocklists.  Hence, you can load
any kernel in the file system from the boot prompt without having to
edit configuration files or rerun a special installation program.

GRUB also automatically detects BIOS lba block addressing.  To force
lba mode see the GRUB `setup` command.  Lilo's install and map 
directives are fulfilled by GRUB's `root` and `setup` commands.  To
reinstall GRUB, the installation location is either determined at 
runtime by the `grub-install` script or given as an option to the 
`setup` command.

more documentation
------------------
the full grub documentation is available in the grub-legacy-doc package.

quick setup
-----------

after installing the package:

1) grub-install "(hd0)"
   or if /boot is a separate partition
   grub-install --root-directory=/boot "(hd0)"

   using in place of "(hd0)" the device that you boot from

2) update-grub which will create a menu.lst for you if one does not exist
   or manually create one, and skip to step 4

3) edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
   or if /boot is a separate partition
   edit /boot/boot/grub/menu.lst

   and change groot, and kopt to whatever settings you need.
   modify anything else in the menu.lst you want,

   re-run update-grub to update the lines for each kernel to those
   that you specified with groot and kopt

4) thats it, making sure you have a rescue disk or some other way to boot
   your machine attempt to reboot using grub!

   to create a grub boot floppy:

   cat /boot/grub/stage1 /boot/grub/stage2 > /dev/fd0
   
   using in place of /dev/fd0 the device that is for your floppy drive.

   note: that you need to run grub-install each time a new grub package
         is installed, this script updates the grub images in /boot/grub
	 or /boot/boot/grub and installs grub into the boot sector.

for more detailed information see the info documentation or manpages

update-grub
-----------
This script is a debian specific addon used to generate a menu.lst for you
either intially, and/or automatically everytime you install a new kernel.

To setup automatic updates add these lines to your /etc/kernel-img.conf:

postinst_hook = update-grub
postrm_hook   = update-grub
do_bootloader = no

For further information see the manpage kernel-img.conf(5) or update-grub(8)

Unlike Lilo, it is not necessary to re-run or re-install the boot loader 
after every change to /boot/grub/menu.lst.  menu.lst is automatically 
found on GRUB's root disk and read during GRUB's boot process.

splashimage support
-------------------
The use of graphics is an unofficial extension to Grub that has not yet been
included by the developers in the official software. The patch
was first proposed on the bug-grub mail list late in 2001. This feature will
not be supported by upstream until after the 1.0 version of Grub is released.

However, this Debian package has been patched and supports splash images.
This is how you can add a splash image to your grub configuration:

1) Be sure to run grub-install, or you will still be running the old
   (unpatched) version

2) Create your image, and transform it into a XPM file, 640x480, with
   14 colors:

   $ convert my-nice-image.jpg -colors 14 -geometry 640x480! my-nice-image.xpm

    gzip it:

   $ gzip my-nice-image.xpm

3) Change your menu.lst file to include the new commands:

# Set colors for foreground and background:
# (RRGGBB, in hex)
#
# These are optional it will still work without them
#
foreground  = ffffff
background  = 000000

# The splash image location (doesn't need to be the root partition, BTW,
# since grub can read your filesystem):
#
splashimage=(hd0,5)/boot/grub/my-nice-image.xpm.gz

4) Reboot, and see your splash image. You may want to fine tune the colors used
   for the text

Note if the path to the splashimage file happens to be wrong you will get a really messed up looking screen.

There is a grub splashimage howto here:

netbsd/freebsd/*bsd
-------------------

Loading kernels from *BSD systems is supported in GRUB 2.  You can upgrade to
GRUB 2 by installing the `grub-pc' package.
