  * Make /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub a real file rather than a
    symlink (closes: #592105).
  * Restrict watch file to match only GRUB Legacy versions.
  * Escape single quotes when removing them from $mode in zz-update-grub, so
    that this works when /bin/sh is bash (thanks, Will Dyson).
  * Run update-grub from kernel hooks if DEB_MAINT_PARAMS is unset, for
    compatibility with old kernel packages.  This may produce duplicate runs
    of update-grub, but that's better than not running it at all.
  * Adjust Maintainer field capitalisation to be consistent with grub2.
