# FreeVMS
Free, libre (CeCill v2, GPL compatible license) re-implementation of OpenVMS. 

Clone of master git from systella.fr

This is the new rewrite based on the L4 kernel (L4Ka Pistachio). (The old 0.3.x series were built upon Linux 2.4).

TODO:

- L4 Pistachio is unsupported...
- Memory management (VMS style) is to be implemented.
- Drivers.

This is a mirror for better availability.
